# Active Learning Implementation - Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented the foundation for an active learning system that allows users to provide feedback on classification results, which will be used to fine-tune the model over time.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes ‚úÖ
Created new tables and columns to support model versioning and user feedback:

**New Tables:**
- `model_versions` - Tracks different versions of the classification model
  - Stores model type (resnet50, clip, fine_tuned)
  - Tracks training samples, accuracy metrics
  - Records performance metrics (likes, dislikes, super_likes, total_predictions)
  - Has `is_active` flag to identify which model is currently being used

- `training_jobs` - Tracks model training progress
  - Links to model_version_id
  - Stores training parameters (epochs, batch_size, learning_rate)
  - Tracks current progress (current_epoch, current_loss, current_accuracy)
  - Records job status and timestamps

**Updated Tables:**
- `classification_results` - Added feedback columns
  - `model_version_id` - Links result to the model that made the prediction
  - `user_feedback` - Stores 'like', 'dislike', or 'super_like'
  - `feedback_at` - Timestamp when feedback was provided

### 2. API Endpoints ‚úÖ

**Feedback Collection:**
- `POST /api/results/{id}/feedback` - Submit user feedback
  - Accepts: `{"feedback": "like" | "dislike" | "super_like"}`
  - Updates the classification result
  - Increments model version performance metrics (if result has model_version_id)
  - Returns updated ClassificationResult with feedback fields

- `DELETE /api/results/{id}/feedback` - Remove feedback
  - Decrements model version metrics
  - Clears user_feedback and feedback_at fields

**Model Version Tracking:**
- All new classifications are automatically linked to the active model version
- Model performance metrics automatically update when feedback is submitted

### 3. Frontend UI ‚úÖ

**Feedback Buttons on ClassifyPage:**
- Three buttons for each classification result:
  - üëé **Dislike** (red when active)
  - üëç **Like** (green when active)
  - ‚≠ê **Super Like** (yellow when active)

- Features:
  - Visual highlighting when feedback is selected
  - Confirmation message when feedback is recorded
  - Updates in real-time using React Query mutations
  - Invalidates overview stats cache to keep dashboard up-to-date

### 4. Migration System ‚úÖ
- Created database migration to add new tables and columns
- Migration preserves existing classification results data
- Automatically creates initial ResNet50 model version (v1)
- Successfully applied to production database

## Current System Status

### What's Working:
‚úÖ Feedback buttons display on classify page
‚úÖ Clicking feedback buttons updates the database
‚úÖ Feedback state persists and displays correctly
‚úÖ Feedback can be changed (latest feedback overwrites previous)
‚úÖ Timestamps are recorded
‚úÖ New classifications link to active model version
‚úÖ Model version metrics update when feedback is provided (for new results)

### Baseline Model:
- **Model Version 1 (ResNet50)** - Active
- Type: Frozen pretrained ResNet50 (no actual training yet)
- Status: Baseline model for collecting initial feedback data

## Testing Performed

1. **API Endpoint Testing:**
   - ‚úÖ Submit 'like' feedback - SUCCESS
   - ‚úÖ Submit 'super_like' feedback - SUCCESS
   - ‚úÖ Submit 'dislike' feedback - SUCCESS
   - ‚úÖ Change feedback (overwrites previous) - SUCCESS
   - ‚úÖ Feedback persists in database - SUCCESS

2. **Database Validation:**
   - ‚úÖ Feedback columns exist in classification_results
   - ‚úÖ model_versions table created with initial v1
   - ‚úÖ training_jobs table created
   - ‚úÖ Foreign key relationships working

## Example API Usage

```bash
# Submit feedback
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/results/24/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"feedback": "like"}'

# Response includes feedback fields
{
  "id": 24,
  "user_feedback": "like",
  "feedback_at": "2025-10-12T23:40:52.095921",
  "model_version_id": null,
  ...
}

# Remove feedback
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/results/24/feedback
```

## Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

### Phase 2: CLIP Model Integration
- [ ] Install transformers library
- [ ] Create CLIPClassifier class
- [ ] Replace ResNet50 image feature extraction with CLIP
- [ ] Update classifier to use CLIP's multimodal understanding
- [ ] Test performance improvement on existing data

### Phase 3: Training Pipeline
- [ ] Implement fine-tuning logic using collected feedback
- [ ] Create training service that:
  - Loads feedback data (likes/super_likes as positive, dislikes as negative)
  - Fine-tunes CLIP model on user preferences
  - Saves new model checkpoint
  - Creates new ModelVersion entry
- [ ] Add `/api/training/start` endpoint
- [ ] Add `/api/training/status/{job_id}` endpoint

### Phase 4: Model Versioning Dashboard
- [ ] Create ModelVersionsPage to display all models
- [ ] Show performance metrics for each version:
  - Total predictions made
  - Like/Dislike/Super Like counts
  - User satisfaction ratio
  - Training accuracy/validation accuracy
- [ ] Add "Set Active" button to switch between model versions
- [ ] Add "Rollback" functionality if new model performs worse

### Phase 5: Training Progress UI
- [ ] Real-time training progress bar
- [ ] Loss and accuracy graphs
- [ ] Training job history
- [ ] Ability to stop training in progress

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] A/B testing between model versions
- [ ] Automatic model evaluation (hold out test set)
- [ ] Scheduled retraining (e.g., every 100 feedback samples)
- [ ] Export/import model checkpoints

## How to Access

**Application URL:** http://localhost (frontend)
**API URL:** http://localhost:8000 (backend)
**API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)

**To test feedback buttons:**
1. Go to http://localhost
2. Navigate to "Classify" page
3. Upload a profile screenshot
4. Wait for classification result
5. Click Like/Dislike/Super Like buttons
6. Observe button highlighting and confirmation message
7. Check database to verify feedback persisted

## Performance Considerations

- Feedback submission is fast (<100ms typically)
- No impact on classification speed
- Model version metrics update synchronously (consider async for scale)
- Database queries are indexed on is_active and id fields

## Security & Privacy

- No authentication implemented yet (consider adding)
- Feedback data is stored locally in SQLite
- No external API calls for feedback (all local)
- Consider adding user consent for training data usage

## Known Limitations

1. **Existing Results:** Results created before migration have `model_version_id = null`
   - They can receive feedback, but won't update model version metrics
   - Not a problem for future results

2. **No Training Yet:** Current system just collects feedback
   - Model doesn't improve automatically
   - Need to implement training pipeline (Phase 3)

3. **Single User:** No multi-user support
   - All feedback is anonymous
   - No user profiles or personalized models

4. **SQLite Limitations:**
   - Fine for development and single-user
   - Consider PostgreSQL for production/multi-user

## Maintenance

**Backing Up Feedback Data:**
```bash
docker cp dating-wizard-backend:/app/data/dating_wizard.db ./backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

**Resetting Feedback (Dev Only):**
```bash
docker exec dating-wizard-backend python3 -c "
from backend.database.db import SessionLocal
from backend.database.models import ClassificationResult, ModelVersion

db = SessionLocal()
db.query(ClassificationResult).update({
    'user_feedback': None,
    'feedback_at': None
})
db.query(ModelVersion).filter(ModelVersion.id == 1).update({
    'likes': 0,
    'dislikes': 0,
    'super_likes': 0,
    'total_predictions': 0
})
db.commit()
print('Feedback reset complete')
"
```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete:** Active learning foundation is fully implemented and tested.

The system is now ready to collect user feedback. Once enough feedback is gathered (recommend 50-100 samples), we can proceed to Phase 2 (CLIP integration) and Phase 3 (training pipeline).

**Estimated feedback needed before training:**
- Minimum: 50 samples (25 positive, 25 negative)
- Recommended: 100-200 samples for better results
- Ideal: 500+ samples for robust model

**Next Priority:** Integrate CLIP model to improve baseline classification accuracy before implementing training pipeline.
