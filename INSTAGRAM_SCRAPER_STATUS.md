# Instagram Scraper Status and Improvements

## Current Status
The Instagram scraper has been enhanced with advanced anti-detection techniques to bypass Instagram's login wall. However, Instagram's bot detection remains aggressive.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Stealth Configuration
- **Randomized window sizes**: Rotates between common resolutions (1920x1080, 1366x768, 1536x864, 1440x900)
- **Randomized user agents**: Cycles through Chrome, Safari, and Firefox user agents
- **Disabled automation flags**:
  - `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`
  - JavaScript overrides for `navigator.webdriver`
  - Added fake navigator properties (languages, plugins)

### 2. Persistent Session Support
- **User data directory**: `/tmp/chrome-profile` to maintain cookies/session between scraping attempts
- This allows the browser to "remember" previous visits and appear more legitimate

### 3. Human-like Behavior Simulation
- **Random delays**:
  - 2-5 seconds before navigation
  - 2-4 seconds after page load
- **Scrolling behavior**:
  - Random scroll down (100-300px)
  - Scroll back up slightly
  - Pause between actions
- **Mouse movement**: Random cursor movements to simulate human interaction

### 4. Login Wall Detection & Metadata Extraction
When Instagram shows the login wall, the scraper now:
1. Detects the login wall by checking for `loginForm`, `Log in to Instagram`, or `Login • Instagram` in page
2. Attempts to extract profile data from Open Graph metadata tags:
   - `og:image` - Profile picture URL
   - `og:description` - Profile bio/description
   - `og:title` - Profile name
3. Saves a screenshot labeled `LOGIN_WALL_{username}_{timestamp}.png`
4. Returns limited profile data with confidence_score = 0.3

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Improved Scraper:
1. Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost)
2. Go to "Instagram Scraper" page
3. Enter a username (e.g., `micaa.vera`, `estherabrami`)
4. Click "Scrape Profile"
5. Check the results:
   - If successful: Profile data appears with image
   - If login wall: Limited metadata extracted (if available)
   - Check backend logs: `docker logs dating-wizard-backend`

### Check Debug Screenshots:
```bash
docker exec dating-wizard-backend ls -lh uploads/screenshots/instagram/
```

Look for:
- `LOGIN_WALL_*.png` - Shows Instagram login page
- `DEBUG_*.png` - Shows what page was loaded

## Known Limitations

### Instagram's Anti-Bot Protection
Instagram uses sophisticated bot detection including:
- IP address tracking and rate limiting
- Browser fingerprinting
- Behavioral analysis
- Cookie/session validation

Even with all stealth measures, Instagram may still block requests.

### Current Workarounds

#### 1. Wait and Retry (Recommended for Development)
Instagram may temporarily block IPs. Wait 24-48 hours and retry.

#### 2. Use Residential Proxies (Production Solution)
```python
# In _setup_selenium, add:
options.add_argument('--proxy-server=http://proxy-provider.com:port')
```

Recommended proxy services:
- Bright Data (formerly Luminati)
- Oxylabs
- SmartProxy
- GeoSurf

#### 3. Use Instagram's Official API (Best Long-term Solution)
- **Instagram Basic Display API**: Free, requires user authentication
- **Instagram Graph API**: For business/creator accounts
- **Third-party APIs**:
  - RapidAPI Instagram scrapers (paid, less reliable)
  - Phantombuster (automation service, paid)

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Manual Authentication
1. Add login functionality to scraper
2. Use user's own Instagram credentials
3. **Risk**: Account may be banned for automation

### Option B: Browser Extension
1. Create Chrome extension that runs in user's actual browser
2. User manually logs into Instagram
3. Extension scrapes profiles in authenticated session
4. **Benefit**: No bot detection issues

### Option C: Public Data Only
1. Accept that only limited metadata is available
2. Use the og: tags approach for basic info
3. Ask users to manually provide their Instagram URL to matches

## Files Modified

- [src/scrapers/instagram_scraper.py](src/scrapers/instagram_scraper.py):
  - Lines 50-74: `_simulate_human_scrolling()` - Human-like scrolling behavior
  - Lines 75-119: `_setup_selenium()` - Enhanced stealth configuration
  - Lines 388-444: Login wall detection and metadata extraction in `_get_profile_data_selenium()`

## Recommendations

### For Development/Testing:
✅ Use the current implementation with metadata extraction fallback
✅ Test with multiple profiles to see success rate
✅ Wait 24 hours between scraping sessions to avoid IP blocks

### For Production:
1. **Short-term**: Use residential proxy rotation service
2. **Medium-term**: Implement Instagram Official API integration
3. **Long-term**: Consider browser extension approach for best UX

## Success Metrics to Track

Once testing:
- **Success rate**: % of profiles scraped without login wall
- **Metadata fallback success**: % of login wall cases where og: tags provide data
- **Profile image extraction**: % of profiles with valid image URLs
- **Bio/description extraction**: % of profiles with bio data

## Next Steps

1. Test the improved scraper on 5-10 different profiles
2. Monitor success rate and debug screenshots
3. If still blocked:
   - Consider waiting 24 hours for IP cooldown
   - Evaluate proxy service costs
   - Discuss Instagram API integration with stakeholder

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# View backend logs in real-time
docker logs -f dating-wizard-backend

# Check if scraper is detecting login wall
docker logs dating-wizard-backend 2>&1 | grep "login wall"

# View all Instagram screenshots
docker exec dating-wizard-backend ls -lh uploads/screenshots/instagram/

# Copy screenshots to local machine for inspection
docker cp dating-wizard-backend:/app/uploads/screenshots/instagram/ ./instagram_screenshots/
```
